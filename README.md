This is Velda Conaty's submission for the Cainthus Frontend Engineer Challenge.

The app allows the user to enter a search string.  The app then retrieves photos
and their details from Flickr and displays them is batches of 20.  The user can
see more images by scrolling down to the bottom.

The app does not work in Internet Explorer. This is due to the use of fetch.
